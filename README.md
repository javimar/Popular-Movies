All movie data comes from themovieDB. You will need an API key to run it. The app is already hooked up to include it from the file "gradle.properties". You must insert a line at the end of the file such as: API_KEY="YOUR API KEY" in order to query the web services.

This app consists of two stages. 

Stage 1:

- A user rating.
- Release date.
